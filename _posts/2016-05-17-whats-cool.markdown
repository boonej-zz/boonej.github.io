welcome
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have spent a good deal of time avoiding this... but I suppose it's 
inevitable. I'm a pretty humble person. 

*Opinionated?* 

Yes. 

*Surly?* 

Sure. 

*Just as likely to punch you in the face as shake your hand?* 

Yep. 

*Constantly
needs reassurance about their technical ability?* 

Negative.

I tend to save my commentary for myself (and whoever is in earshot) and avoid 
putting pen to paper on the subject. That said, I do know a thing or two about
a thing or two and it has been said that I should share said *things*.

So here we are.

me
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was not born a programmer. Sure, I was weened on a TRS-80 and was dialing in 
to BBS (BBSes... BBSs... not sure how to pluralize that) to get cracked ATARI 
games in my single digit years BUUUUT it was never something that I considered
a career option.

My first real passion was music. I would like to think I was pretty good, nay, 
a prodigy. I'm sure that a hundred years from now, some guy will stumble on the
ruins of my garage and find all my lost 4-track tapes. He'll spend 20 years 
developing a device to play them and succeed. He'll then bring all of his 
colleagues, family, friends, and whoever else is around to listen to the 
glories that I wrote and produced. When he presses **PLAY**, the room will 
sink into a hush, then a jumble of static and muddled garble will fill the room 
- the contents of the tapes long lost (as cassette tapes last maybe 15 seconds 
from the time they were recorded).

I put a lot of stock in the music gig. I learned to play instruments. I wrote 
a ton of songs, played in plenty of venues, moved to Nashville, and ran away 
from Nashville. Between the odd hours, band-mates who found me a bit abrasive, 
and laziness the music thing did not work out for me.

paying my dues
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While I chased my music dreams, I had to have a lot of different *jobs*. In 
retrospect, each one led me further and further down the path to coding. 

*What jobs did you have?*

Well I'm glad you asked. Here's a quick rundown:

+ **Prepress** - let's lay out some ads! Looking back, this was an incredibly 
valuable experience. I cut my teeth on a few applications that I use pretty 
regularly AND I can talk to designers and sound like I know what I'm talking
about. I got the job as a fluke, but I was pretty good at it.

+ **DJ** - I learned that I did NOT want to work in a bar - any form or 
fashion.

+ **Chauffer** - Drove a Ferrari and I can back up like a demon.

+ **Camera Sales Guy** - Enhanced my knowledge (and love) of photography.
This helps with designers. 

+ **Coffee Shop Manager** - I know a lot about coffee... we all know that is 
critical to a successful application.

+ **Retail Manager** - I was exposed to a lot of different legacy systems, 
learned to deal with bureaucracy, and honed my abrasiveness.

+ **Store Tech Guy** - This is the first job where I actually did any 
coding. At the time, the company did not have a rigid bureaucracy and rewarded 
people who made contributions. So I contributed. I saw a few things that I 
thought could work better in my store, learned to code the fix, then got
promoted and kept getting promoted. 

*So, is that what I need to do to be a programmer?*

Probably not, but nowadays it does take some time to find your way. However you
find it, you find it. If you go my way, you'll have plenty of cowboy years 
where you will be the object of coworker hatred. In fact, if someone reminds me
of a younger me, I don't hire them. I want the older me.

and so it comes to pass
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything I've learned, I've learned from messing something up, rushing, not
taking time to plan, cowboy coding, and coding by coincidence. Not a fine 
philosophy, but it has gotten me to this point. Now I am far more cautious and
pragmatic - but I'm also getting old.

I would love to pass on wisdom for the younger whipper-snappers, but all my
tales are cautionary. The best I can do is to tell you to find your own path.
Don't try to follow anyone else's. Never trust anyone who's always dreamed of 
being [anything]. Dreams are only for people who haven't discovered their 
*special purpose*.
