In the mid 2000s I was a low level coder in a business environment that was dominated
by enterprise contracts and big budget software. Our go-to CMS was SharePoint and 
that was that. When my role changed to R&D, I needed to get prototypes out the door 
quickly and move on the next one. My coworker introduced me to Wordpress and I was 
very impressed. Even then, the plugin community was vibrant and you could turn the 
platform into _anything_. Life got easier very quickly.

Before that point, most of the web code that I had worked with was .NET based. 
The move to PHP was welcome and refreshing. PHP was (and is) a simple language
with a dedicated community that worked to constantly extend its features. It 
was code-cowboy heaven. We churned out prototypes very quickly (with little 
functionality). They did all look pretty much the same though. Got to love 
that wordpress look.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When all you see is nails, it gets pretty hard to innovate. We got stuck in a rut and 
needed something else. I wrote a few solutions with pure PHP and no framework, but 
it just took forever. I cannot overstate the need to use frameworks to take away some
of the drudgery of writing code. I also cannot overstate the need to understand 
**EVERYTHING** the framework is doing for you.

Over the years I've developed a certain aesthetic regarding any kind of code framework,
CMS, or IDE. I haven't really tried to put it to paper until now.

**A FRAMEWORK SHOULD**

+ do the stuff you need it to
+ not do anything you don't need it to

A good framework stays out of your way while making your job easier. Wordpress is not 
a framework. It is a blogging platform that has been bastardized into an out of control
monster that gets used (and abused) for any task the web has to offer.

*"What framework do you recommend?"* You might ask.

Any of them, if they do what you need without doing anything that you don't. Again, 
if you are running an e-commerce site, there is no reason for you to use a blog to 
host it.

notes/q&a
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**JB, you started giving a lot of personal detail then derailed. What gives?**

It is a rant... and I was drinking.

**So, you're a PHP developer?**

Noooooooooooo.

**Are there any technical reasons you dislike Wordpress**

Yes. After the mid-2000s, I was exposed to A LOT of different languages, frameworks
and expanded my skill set greatly. I've recently had to revisit the hellish wastes
of wordpress and find it, for the lack of a better term, unorganized... haphazard even.

Don't get me wrong, a lot of great things have been done with WP... but they could have
probably been done better with something else.

**Would you reccomend Wordpress for anything?**

A blog... or maybe a blog post - but it would be boring.

**There are a lot of legitimate companies using Wordpress to host serious sites. What
do you have to say about that?**

They probably shouldn't. I attribute that to the ease of building prototypes in WP. 
The prototypes that I was making in R&D had the nasty habit of going into production. 

**Why are you complaining about Wordpress now?**

Isn't it obvious?

**What are you drinking?**

Scotch.
