brain rust
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you don't use a tool, it rusts. You can take steps to prevent it from 
rusting, like keeping it oiled, but that also requires constant attention. A 
brief lapse in vigilance opens the door to oxidation.

As a programmer, you use plenty of tools. Your brain should be the tool that 
you use the most. That is certainly the case when just getting started
with a project. But even then, oxidation can set in if you are using the same 
technologies you always do. As projects wear on a few other things happen. 
You may spend more time on autopilot. You may be spending more of your time
on maintenance than anything else. Your logical faculties may be wasting away 
behind a facade of busyness.

lube up
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you stop it, you ask? Slap some grease on that puppy.

There are plenty of ways to lubricate a brain. Just about anything that 
you can do do generate original thought or make your brain work will work. 
You could make it applicable to your current project, or an old project, or
nothing at all. You just *have* to do it.

It gets worse as you get older and more experienced. All knowledge becomes
precious and fleeting. It takes less and less time for rust to set in -- and
when it does it is more devastating than ever. Trust me, I'm a 
scientist.  

While I'm no expert on brain lube, I DO have a few theories and things that I
have always done. I also am always looking for other new things to keep my mind
fresh.

### you must relearn what you (should) have learned

Do you remember everything you learned in middle school? I don't. I'm not sure 
if I learned what I was supposed to then. I believe that excellence lies in the
details. *All* of the little details. When you are focused on passing a class, 
some of those details get overlooked. Brush off some old textbooks, rework 
exercises. This is extremely important for things that you don't use very 
often in your daily work. 

### learn something new

Keep it fresh. A developer should get exposed to several new languages every 
year. When I say exposed, I mean actively coding. Every time I play with a new 
language, I start thinking differently. I see solutions that I didn't always 
see. You also have the satisfaction of knowing that you aren't a one trick 
pony.

### create and share

Anything. Keep a blog (ah... now it's coming together) of your exploits. Share
your knowledge librally. Play music. Skim through some old projects and find 
things that you thought were novel at the time. Pull them out, modularize them,
refactor them like you always wanted, and open source those suckers. Always 
be making.

### do stuff

Learn to love a sport. Not just watching, doing. If you have kids, coach a 
team. Don't just go through the motions. Learn everything you can, techniques,
nuances. Make yourself a better player than you were so you can pass that 
on. If you don't have kids, join a league - any league will do. Dedicate 
yourself to a sport and a team and LEARN. Some programmers may not have 
spent a good deal of time playing organized sports and that's a shame. Most
of life's most valuable lessons can be learned on a field somewhere.

repeat
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Come up with something that works for you and keep it varied. It doesn't hurt
to work some social thinking into the mix. Social skills get rust too -- 
especially if you work from home. Keep doing it, never stop. Your brain will 
thank you.

**ALWAYS BE LUBING UP (YOUR BRAIN)**
