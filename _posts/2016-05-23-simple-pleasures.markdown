little thrills
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About a week ago, I had an experience that was unexpectedly pleasing. I was 
taking a bit of my own advice and pulling some code out of an old project and
converting it to a handy node module. At first, I started off just rewriting it
to use in MY project. As I continued developing, I started thinking that 
someone else may find it useful.

So I changed my tactics and wrote it in a way that could be reused. I had never
published a node module and figured I could turn it into a learning experience.
The code itself is not particularly novel. It is merely a string parser to 
strip OpenGraph metadata from remote websites. There are a lot of metadata 
crawlers out there, but I tend to avoid things that are TOO configurable. The
ability to use a wrench as a hammer is valuable in a pinch, but if given the
choice I would use a hammer.

The end result is pretty ok. I doubt it will change anyone's life, generate any
revenue for anyone, or make any noticeable impact on the world in general.

what's the point?

Why are you saying anything about it, you ask?

I got an unexpected amount of pleasure from the experience. The first was what
I can only think an exhibitionist feels when bearing his junk. I opened that 
trench coat and exposed my bits... and it felt GOOOOOD. That may not paint the
prettiest of pictures, I apologize for the visual. 

The buildup to the flashing was a unique experience as well. Because I was 
planning on showing the code to a larger group of people than an internal team,
I spent *A LITTLE* more time grooming it. I tried a few libraries that I 
hadn't used before on the dev side and eliminated any dependencies for the 
consumer (which was fun).

When I published it, I realized how well the npm system has been 
implemented and have come to truly implement it. It felt like I found 
my special purpose, and I want to use it a lot.[^jerk]. That inspired me to
start digging through the same project for some truly novel tools to publish,
which I will.

what's in it for me?

It is easy to forget what makes your work rewarding. Sometimes, you have to 
get granular. Look to the little things. You may be surprised how doing 
something small and unimportant can change your outlook on the world for a 
little while. 

Even though the joy is temporary, little things are little. It doesn't take a
lot to do a lot of little things. If you always do the little things, wouldn't 
the buzz last longer? Maybe. Or you may just go broke.
